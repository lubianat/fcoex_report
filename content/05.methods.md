## Preprocessing 

### pbmc3k dataset preprocessing 
__pbmc3k__ was loaded as a Seurat object from the SeuratData package. The expression matrix in the “data” slot and the labels in the “Idents” slot as input for creating the _fcoex_ object.

# Gene expression discretization 
As the original Fast Correlation-Based Filter [@wikidata:Q106704674] algorithm was constructed to deal with discrete data, we had to discretize gene counts. We chose as a discretization metric a min-max-percent approach. For each gene, we took the lowest and the highest normalized value across the cells. We set a threshold at 25% of the max-min range. All the values below this threshold were considered “OFF,” and all above was “ON”. 

# Identification of _fcoex_ modules 

## Filtering genes by correlation to labels 

After the discretization step, genes were ranked by their correlation to labels previously assigned by the Seurat Data team. The correlation metric we used was the nonlinear Symmetrical Uncertainty, a variation of mutual information that maps the values between 0 (worst) and 1 (best), and accounts for differences in entropy ranges that arise when variables have a different number of classes (number of labels and number of gene classes). All downstream steps were performed only with the previously filtered genes

## Building the coexpression network
Each module M is composed of one module seed (x) predominantly-correlated to the label (L) and all the genes (Yi) more correlated to the seed than to the label.
In practice, the algorithm builds an all x all correlation matrix by symmetrical uncetainty, the adjacency matrix of the co-expression network. This adjacency matrix is then trimmed, and edges between nodes Yi and Yj are removed from the network iff SU(Yi, Yj) < SU(Yi, L) or SU(Yi, Yj) < SU(Yj, L). 
Inferring coexpression modules
Modules were built in a bottom-up approach, first selecting genes predominantly correlated to the labels. These genes are the output of the Fast Correlation-Based Filter  (FCBF) algorithm for feature selection.
Each selected featured forms a new cluster, corresponding to all the genes associated to it in the trimmed network. The modules formed in that way are fuzzy, as a gene might belong to several modules. 

## Reclustering of cells
To recluster the cells based on each module, we use the “recluster” function of the _fcoex_ module. It uses the gene sets in each co-expression community to subset the expression table given originally as input. This reduced table contains the expression values regarding those genes for all the cells in the dataset.
The distances between cells in this reduced matrix was calculated by the manhattan distance, and hierarchical clustering was performed. The metric used to calculate the linkage distance between groups was the “ward.D2” metric as implemented in the hclust function of the stats package in R 3.6.1. Two groups of cells were retrieved from each  clustering (the k parameter was set to 2) .
## Code availability 
The _fcoex_ package, which performs the coexpression analysis is available at <http://bioconductor.org/packages/fcoex/>. The discretization and feature selection algorithms are available in a second package, FCBF (<http://bioconductor.org/packages/FCBF/>). All the analyses performed for this work are available at <https://github.com/lubianat/fcoex paper>.
